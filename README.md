## Application Factsheet
This web-development project was based on creating a memory game, alongside the home, about and illustration pages.
In order to use this application, download the source code and open the index.html file in a browser, preferably in
either Chrome or Firefox. Once you open the index.html file, you will see the application home page:

The home page simply provides you with another navigation option away from the sidebar navigation. You can click onto the buttons in each section and then navigate to specific page. Next, you have the about page:

The about page has 3 sections containing information about myself. You can click on the buttons to navigate to each part. Each segment will present you with information about either, education, interests or background. Next up, the illustration page:

The illustration page provides you with a step-by-step mini-tutorial on how to play the memory sequence game. You simply start from "How to Play" and move across to steps, 1, 2 and 3.

The game page is where the the player will interact with the Hue lights by watching the light sequence presented to them and then repeating that same sequence into the game pages light buttons. This page provides many different features, such as:

- Score-board: Keeps track of players progress through the game and current heighest-score.
- Interactive Light sequence buttons: These buttons will keep track of your current level progress.
- Game-status board: Informs the player about their current level sesssions time, and their status.
- Status-checking: Each light button pressed will invoke a checking feature that checks to see if the player has passsed or failed.

## Browser Compatibility
This project also provides compatibility across multiple different browsers, such as Firefox and Chrome. You can see below, a few examples of Chrome and Firefox comparisons:

### Chrome & Firefox: About Page

#### Chrome
<img width="1280" alt="Screenshot 2020-01-09 at 02 50 02" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57765615/72033727-08573f80-328b-11ea-9f0d-e05c9c3f0ef1.png">

#### Firefox
<img width="1280" alt="Screenshot 2020-01-09 at 02 48 31" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57765615/72033688-f1b0e880-328a-11ea-8a91-e7858003778e.png">

### Chrome & Firefox: Game Page

#### Chrome
<img width="1280" alt="Screenshot 2020-01-09 at 02 49 42" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57765615/72033777-2ae95880-328b-11ea-95db-af157da803c1.png">

#### Firefox
<img width="1280" alt="Screenshot 2020-01-09 at 02 48 49" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57765615/72033750-1c9b3c80-328b-11ea-86a4-ac11a2e9ba9e.png">

## Web Accessibility
The application itself could have done more in providing better web accessibility options for those with disabilities or impairments, though there are areas on the site, such as on the game page that keeps the tabbing functionality on buttons and also on images, the alt tags are used to present a textual representation of what the image is showing. As you can see below:

<img width="1280" alt="Screenshot 2020-01-09 at 03 19 29" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57765615/72035156-faa3b900-328e-11ea-9a20-19613762fb13.png">
You can see the 'Start Game' button still keeps its outlining to indicate to a user where they are, and they can use tabbing to click the button also.
